# To-Do List for Financial Suitability Form Implementation

## Objective

Transform the existing application from demonstrating weather retrieval to filling out a financial suitability form using the real-time API.

## Instructions

Complete 1 item at a time. Once the item is completed, fill in the checkbox, and then move on to the next item.

Also for each iteration, review the plan.md file and to-do list, and assess whether we need to make any changes to the plan.

    - [ ] Ensure fields update as data is processed.

## Technical Steps

### 1. Voice Input Handling

- **Utilize the existing `WavRecorder` for capturing voice input.**

  - [ ] Review the `WavRecorder` component code.
  - [ ] Modify `WavRecorder` to handle three separate recordings.
  - [ ] Ensure recordings are saved in a compatible format for the API.

- **Ensure the `RealtimeClient` is set up to handle voice input and transcription.**
  - [ ] Update `RealtimeClient` to accept multiple audio inputs.
  - [ ] Implement functions to send audio data to the API.
  - [ ] Handle transcription responses and map them to form fields.

### 2. API Function Calls

- **Modify or add new tools in the `RealtimeClient` to handle form filling logic.**

  - [ ] Create functions to process transcribed text.
  - [ ] Map transcriptions to corresponding form fields.
  - [ ] Implement logic to handle incomplete or ambiguous data.

- **Implement a new function to process the financial data and update the form fields.**
  - [ ] Develop a data processing module within `RealtimeClient`.
  - [ ] Ensure processed data correctly updates the UI in real-time.
  - [ ] Handle edge cases and data inconsistencies.

### 3. Form Management

- **Create a new component or modify an existing one to display the financial suitability form.**

  - [ ] Design the form layout with all required fields.
  - [ ] Implement the form component in React.
  - [ ] Ensure the form is responsive and user-friendly.

- **Ensure the form updates in real-time as the user provides input.**
  - [ ] Implement state management for form data.
  - [ ] Use React hooks or state management libraries to handle real-time updates.
  - [ ] Test real-time data binding between `RealtimeClient` and the form.

### 4. User Interaction

- **Provide feedback to the user through the real-time API, prompting for more information if needed.**

  - [ ] Develop prompts for cases where additional information is required.
  - [ ] Integrate prompts into the user interface.
  - [ ] Ensure prompts are clear and concise.

- **Use the `WavStreamPlayer` to play back responses or confirmations to the user.**
  - [ ] Integrate `WavStreamPlayer` with the form submission process.
  - [ ] Implement audio feedback for successful data submission.
  - [ ] Handle playback errors gracefully.

### 5. Code Modifications

- **Update `ConsolePage.tsx`:**

  - [ ] Add logic to handle new form-related function calls.
  - [ ] Implement event handlers for form interactions.
  - [ ] Ensure seamless integration with existing page components.

- **Modify `conversation_config.js`:**
  - [ ] Update AI instructions to handle financial data input.
  - [ ] Test AI responses to ensure they align with form requirements.
  - [ ] Refine configuration for better data accuracy.

### 6. Testing and Validation

- **Test the application with various inputs to ensure the form is filled out accurately.**

  - [ ] Create a suite of test cases with different voice inputs.
  - [ ] Automate testing for form data accuracy.
  - [ ] Perform manual testing for edge cases.

- **Validate the voice input and transcription accuracy.**
